## Remove the '..5.u.S' leftover ##
## THe reason why this sus file is created is because users have grant the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission for the apps that detecting sus files in /sdcard, or in /sdcard/Android/data where the apps are exploiting the unicode bugs to create files arbitrary.
## susfs redirects the sus path to a supposed not-existing path named '..5.u.S', and this is the only way to settle the cross check of returned errno from various syscalls, but one disadvantage is that if the path itself can be written/created by the app (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE granted), then it is futile to hide it, but at least here we automatically delete them on each boot.
## The best practise is to revoke MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission for all third party apps.

## - Please note that it is better to do it in boot-completed starge
##   Since some target path may be mounted by ksu, and make sure the
##   target path has the same dev number as the one in global mnt ns,
##   otherwise the sus map flag won't be seen on the umounted process.
## - To debug with this, users can do this in a root shell:
##   1. Find the pid and uid of a opened umounted app by running
##      ps -enf | grep myapp
##   2. cat /proc/<pid_of_myapp>/maps | grep "<added/sus_map/path>"'
##   3. In other root shell, run
##      cat /proc/1/mountinfo | grep "<added/sus_map/path>"'
##   4. Finally compare the dev number with both output and see if they are consistent,
##      if so, then it should be working, but if not, then the added sus_map path
##      is probably not working, and you have to find out which mnt ns the dev number
##      from step 2 belongs to, and add the path from that mnt ns:
